               <p> In addition to my hobbies, I also love cats, big breakfasts, books, strategy videogames, and learning foreign languages. I believe that learning languages is not only useful but also a great way to connect with people from different cultures.
                
                I'm excited to see where my interests in coding and food styling take me in the future, and I hope to continue learning and exploring new things along the way.</p>
